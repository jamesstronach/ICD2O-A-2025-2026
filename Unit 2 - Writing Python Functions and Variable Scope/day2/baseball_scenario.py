# Scenario: Baseball Player Performance Tracker
# You are helping a baseball coach track player performance over a series of games. The functions below are used to calculate stats, print game summaries, and convert data for reporting. Some functions return one value, some return multiple values, and some simply print information.
# Provided Functions

# Displays the header for the stat tracker
# Parameters: none
# Returns: nothing
def show_tracker_header():
    print("Baseball Performance Tracker")
# Calculates batting average
# Parameters: hits (int), at_bats (int)
# Returns: batting average (float)
def get_batting_average(hits, at_bats):
    return hits / at_bats
# Prints a summary of a player's game stats
# Parameters: name (string), hits (int), at_bats (int)
# Returns: nothing
def print_game_summary(name, hits, at_bats):
    print(name + " had " + str(hits) + " hits in " + str(at_bats) + " at-bats.")
# Returns total bases and slugging percentage
# Parameters: singles (int), doubles (int), triples (int), home_runs (int), at_bats (int)
# Returns: (total bases (int), slugging (float))
def get_power_stats(singles, doubles, triples, home_runs, at_bats):
    total_bases = singles + 2 * doubles + 3 * triples + 4 * home_runs
    slugging = total_bases / at_bats
    return total_bases, slugging
# Converts a speed from miles per hour to kilometers per hour
# Parameters: mph (float)
# Returns: speed in kph (float)
def mph_to_kph(mph):
    return mph * 1.60934
# Prints a player's pitch velocity and location
# Parameters: speed (float), location (string)
# Returns: nothing
def log_pitch(speed, location):
    print("Pitch thrown at " + str(speed) + " mph to " + location + ".")
# Returns the ERA (earned run average) for a pitcher
# Parameters: earned_runs (int), innings_pitched (float)
# Returns: ERA (float)
def calculate_era(earned_runs, innings_pitched):
    return (earned_runs * 9) / innings_pitched
# Returns the strikeout-to-walk ratio
# Parameters: strikeouts (int), walks (int)
# Returns: ratio (float)
def get_kbb_ratio(strikeouts, walks):
    return strikeouts / walks
# Returns player name and position in a formatted string
# Parameters: name (string), position (string)
# Returns: summary string (string)
def format_player_info(name, position):
    return name + " plays " + position
# Displays a closing message
# Parameters: none
# Returns: nothing

    print("End of performance report.")

# Tasks
# 1. Call show_tracker_header().
# 2. Call get_batting_average() using 3 hits and 5 at-bats. Store the result in avg and print it.
# 3. Call print_game_summary() for player 'Jaylen' with 2 hits and 4 at-bats.
# 4. Call get_power_stats() using: 1 single, 1 double, 0 triples, 1 home run, 4 at-bats. Store total bases and slugging.
# 5. Call mph_to_kph() with 92.5 mph and store result in kph. Print it.
# 6. Call log_pitch() with speed 89.6 and location 'outside corner'.
# 7. Call calculate_era() with 2 earned runs over 6.2 innings. Store and print ERA.
# 8. Call get_kbb_ratio() with 9 strikeouts and 3 walks. Store and print the ratio.
# 9. Call format_player_info() with 'Liam' and 'shortstop'. Store and print the result.
# 10. Call end_tracker().
